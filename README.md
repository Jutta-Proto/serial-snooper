# UI
A `C++20` based implementation to snoop the traffic between an JURA coffee maker and the [Smart Control](https://uk.jura.com/en/homeproducts/accessories/SmartConnect-Main-72167) dongle.
The used protocol for deobfuscating the send data can be found [here](https://github.com/Jutta-Proto/protocol-cpp).

## Requirements
The following requirements are required to build this project.
* A C++20 compatible compiler like [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
* The build system is written using [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* For managing dependencies in CMake, we are using [conan](https://conan.io/)

### Fedora
To install those dependencies on Fedora, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y gcc clang cmake python3 python3-pip
pip3 install --user conan
```

### Raspberry Pi
To install those dependencies on a Raspberry Pi, running the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt install -y cmake python3 python3-pip
pip3 install --user conan
```

## Building
Run the following commands to build this project:
```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Jutta-Proto/serial-snooper.git
# Switch into the newly cloned repository:
cd serial-snooper
# Build the project:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Hardware
The following image shows you how to connect the coffee maker, Raspberry Pi and the Smart Connect dongle between each other, so you are able to snoop data.

![Pinout Raspberry Pi](misc/Pinout_Raspberry_Pi.png)

Depending on where you place the purple wire in the blue box (RX0 or TX1), you listen to the traffic from or to the coffee maker.

* **RX0**: Listening to the traffic send **from** the coffee maker.
* **RX0**: Listening to the traffic send **to** the coffee maker.

## Running
Once successfully build, you can run the snooper like follows:
```bash
./src/Jutta-Snooper
```

Once running, it creates the `output` directory containing three files:
* `log.txt`: Basic log with the text that got read.
* `raw.bin`: The binary data, that got read.
* `raw_with_lines.bin`: The binary data, that got read with a `\n` between each line read.

In case the `output` directory already exists, it will be moved to `output_TIME`, where `TIME` is the current time in milliseconds.

## Stopping
To stop the execution press `Ctrl + C` and the snooper should stop.
